## Couple of lines of the project aims
The aim of this project was to analyse whether women are underrepresented in Scottish politics, by looking at not only the number of women there are in parliament, but whether women get the same chance to speak in Parliamentary debates as men. Our plan for the final product was to visualise the data to tell a story about women's representation in Scottish parliament, using other variables such as time, region, and age to give a succint narrative.


## Why you chose your topic
We chose our topic as we wanted to embark on a data science project that would contribute meaningfully and positively to the social sciences. Inspired by femininst thought and advocation for greater representation on women in politics, we wanted to use data science tools to quantify the extent to which this is the case in Scottish parliament, to inform future research and dicsussion on what can be done to level the playing field.


## What you learned from this - results + skill development
### Results
Our results can be condensed into four bullet points:
1. There are disproportionally less women elected to Scottish parliament
2. In the first and second parliament, women's speaking time was disproportionally lower than the amount of women MSPs there were
3. In the third and fourth parliament, women are speaking close to proportionality to the amount of seats they have
4. A higher proportion of speeches that mention women's issues are delivered by women

Put together, this allows us to conclude that there exists a substantive gender representation gap: the onus of fighting for women's rights issues is born more by women than by men. This trend also shows that that descriptive representation (the amount of women and how much they contribute) is highly related to substantive representation in this context (what the parliament does for women).

### Skill development
In this project we leveraged skills taught in DS105: using GitHub, using the Terminal, interacting with APIs - https protocol, SQL and SPARQL - and cleaning, analysing and visualizing structured data. We adapted NLP methodology taught through DS105 workshops to support our exploration of the content of speeches. These tools enabled us to look for markers of gender discrimination through three different prisms.
