## Couple of lines of the project aims
In this project we analysed whether women are underrepresented in Scottish politics
In this project we extended what is meant by representation. As well as the pure number of women there are in parliament, we were interested in whether women get the same chance to speak in Parliamentary debates.
Aims:
Use parliamentary transcripts to quantify how much women and men speak and relate our findings to patterns in other demographic variables such as age and region.
Run a content analysis to see whether gender correlates with whether MSPs talk about womens' issues.
Visualise the data we find to tell a story about women's representation in the Scottish Parliament

## Why you chose your topic
Fourth-wave feminism's advocation for greater representation of women in politics is premised on the notion that society would be more equitable if policies incorporate perspectives of all people
Inspired by this argument for the equitable representation of gendered perspectives in political settings, we were interested in exploring women's representation in Scottish parliament across time to see the progress Scotland has made in not only including more women in parliamentary debates, but by including more contributions by women to the debates themselves
We wanted to use the data science tools we have learned about to quantify the extent to which women are represented in parliamentary politics. The case we looked at was the Scottish Parliament.


## What you learned from this - results + skill development
### Results
Firstly, we found that disproportionally less women are elected to the Scottish Parliament. There has been little change in this since 1999. Thus our analysis confirmed a well-known fact that there exists a persisting gender disparity in parliament in terms of descriptive representation.

Secondly, we explored whether women who are in parliament speak more or less than men. We found that in the first and second parliament, that women's speaking time was disproportionally lower than the amount of women MSPs there were. This shows that women are underrepresented in terms of the time that women are speaking in Parliament. Not only did women have disproportionally less parliamentary seats than women in the population, this gap was aggravated the gap in the amount they speak.

A positive takeaway is that this gap decreased over time. Women are now speaking close to proportionally to the amount of seats they have. However, because women still do not make up 50% of seats, there is still not equal representation.

Finally, we looked at whether women talked more about women's rights issues than men. Analysis using NLP revealed that, despite the perceptible trend towards more equal involvement of men and women in gender issues, a higher proportion of speeches that mention women's issues are delivered by women. This allows us to conclude that there exists a substantive gender representation gap: the onus of fighting for women's rights issues is born more by women than by men. This tend also shows that that descriptive representation (the amount of women and how much they contribute) is highly related to substantive representation in this context (what the parliament does for women).

### Skill development
In this project we leveraged skills taught in DS105: using GitHub, using the Terminal, interacting with APIs - https protocol, SQL and SPARQL - and cleaning, analysing and visualizing structured data. We adapted NLP methodology taught through DS105 workshops to support our exploration of the content of speeches. These tools enabled us to look for markers of gender discrimination through three different prisms.
