### Motivation - Len
* Want to contribute to social sciences
* Inspired by feminist belief that greater political representation = greater equity
* Using data science to inform future research and discussion on issue

### Aim - Alanah
* Analyse whether women are underrepresented in Scottish politics
* Looking at number of women in parliament, whether women get the same chance to speak in debates as men, and about who is speaking more about women's issues
* Wanted to visualise findings into a narrative on Tableau


### Results - Naeomie
We found that
* There are disproportionally less women elected to Scottish parliament
* In the first and second parliament, women's speaking time was disproportionally lower than the amount of women MSPs there were
* In the third and fourth parliament, women are speaking close to proportionality to the amount of seats they have
* A higher proportion of speeches that mention women's issues are delivered by women

### Learnings (conclusions) - Len + Naeomie
Put together, this allows us to conclude that there exists a substantive gender representation gap: the onus of fighting for women's rights issues is born more by women than by men. This trend also shows that that descriptive representation (the amount of women and how much they contribute) is highly related to substantive representation in this context (what the parliament does for women).


### Learnings (skills) - Alanah
* Project gave us ability to develop key skills in data science, such as
* Using GitHub to centralise and streamline our workflow
* Using the Terminal
* Interacting with APIs such as https protocols, SQL, and SPARQL
* Cleaning, analysing, and visualising structured data using R and python, as well as Tableau
* We also adapted NLP methodolgy to support our exploration of the content on speeches
