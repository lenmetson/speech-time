# Are women underrepresented in Scottish politics?

This project was created as an assignment for a course called *DS105M - Data for Data Science*. The project group was completed by Alanah Sarginson, No√©mie Claret and Len Metson.

It aims to quantify and visualise the amount of time that different MPs speak in legislative settings. Our final product will be a story of visualisations hosted on Tableau Public, hosted on GitHub.

The data extraction and analysis part of this project is fully reproducible. In order to run the code on your machine you need to install R, RStudio and Python.

Once you have done this clone out repository into a local folder on your machine. Opening 'speech-time.Rproj' will open an environment in RStudio where you can find all the scripts we used as well as  the raw code for our Rmarkdown presentations.


Note for Len:
git reset --soft HEAD~1
