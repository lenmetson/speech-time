# Our plan 

## Section 1: Workflow and data retrival

* Workflow philosphy - reproducible research (LEN)
  * What: we want the entire project to be able to be run by any user on any machine, with no cost to themselves
  * Why reproducible 
  * Show work-flow 
  * Show GitHub and how we interact with it 
    * External reasons; 
      * Reproducibliy, transpatency
    * Internal reason; 
      * Collaboration, version control, file backup
 
 * How we achieve that 
   * Download from HTML (explain this) progromatically

 * Show work flow, GitHub set up 
 * External reasons: 
   *  Reproducibility, transparency
 * Internal reasons:
 * Collaboration, version control, backup


* How do we get the data? 


## Section 2: Data processing, and summary stats 

* How we cleaned the data 

* What's going on? 
  * MP descriptives 
    * How many MPs 
    * How many are women/men? 
    * How many are regional/constituency?
  * Speech descriptives 
    * How many speeches? 
    * How many overall by women? 
    * How many of each type? 
    * Table: MP descriptive + no of speeches 
    * How many years?
    * How many debates?


## Section 3: Where we're going with the data 

* Data analysis
  * What MP descriptives we'll extract
    * Ages of MPs
    * Political parties of MPs
  * What speech descriptives we'll extract
    * Speech time of women/men
  * What tools we're using
    * R
      * Downloading the raw data
      * Counting sylablles
    * Python
      * Formatting the dataset
      * Scraping the Twitter API 
  
* Data visualiation (AS to finish)
  * What we want to visualise
    * Change in gender differences of speech time over time
      * Line graph
    * Power in parliament represented by amount of seats taken up once gender differences in speech time is considered
    * Relationship between speech time and age
    * Absolute gender difference in amount of speech
    * Proportions of time men and women speak
    * Party comparison of women speech time
    * Comparison of Twitter followers and speech time
  * What tools we're using
    * Tableau Public


* User interface (Len can you assist)
  *
