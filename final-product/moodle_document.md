# Notes

## Motivation for our project
* Fourth-wave feminism's advocation for greater representation of women - including traditionally marginalised groups such as women of colour and trans women - in politics is premised on the notion that society would be more equitable if policies incorporate perspectives of all people
* Inspired by this argument for the equitable representation of gendered perspectives in political settings, we were interested in exploring women's representation in Scottish parliament across time to see the progress Scotland has made in not only including more women in parliamentary debates, but by including more contributions by women to the debates themselves

## Justification for our project


## Aim
We wanted to measure the length of each speech in Scottish Parliament by the number of syllables in each speech. These could then be aggregated to estimate each MSPs total speech time.

## Data
We used a pre-scrapped dataset of speeches by Scottish Members of Parliament (MSPs). The data has entries from the opening of the Scottish Parliament so we were able to analyse all speeches made in the Scottish Parliament.

The relevant dataset was downloaded by HTTP request using an R wrapper.

### Descriptive statistics on Raw Data


|          | Total   | Female  | % Female |
|----------|---------|---------|----------|
| Speeches | 430,577 | 125,078 | 29.05%   |
| MSPs     | 306     | 105     | 34.31%   |



## Methodology

Steps:


## Results
We found some interesting descriptive results about the role of women in Scottish Parliamentary proceedings. Initially, female MSPs spoke disproportionally less than there were women in the Scottish Parliament. However, over time, this rose so that women were speaking roughly as much as there women in Parliament. This being said, much of this trend is driven by Nicola Sturgeon becoming First Minister.
