We used an online [parliamentary seat map maker](https://parliamentdiagram.toolforge.org/parlitest.php) and data we found on the 'real' number of seats taken up by gender once speech time is considered (done by multiplying the ratio of % speech proportion to % MSP proportion by the number of seats taken up by each gender) to create these seat maps as SVGs
We then imported these as images on Tableau
