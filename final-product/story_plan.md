# Are women underrepresented in Scottish politics?
## Overview
Ways we have analysed representation:
1.  Amount of time spent speaking in parliament - integrating other factors' effects for an intersectional analysis
2.  Parliamentary discussions on women's topics

### Absolute gender differences in amount of speech
* When we sum the parliamentary data on speeches across all sessions, we can see that comparatively, men have spoken more than women
* We can observe this disparity through the visual contrast of these speech bubbles, with men having spoken s = 119M syllables, and women just s = 64M
* If we take the average speech time to be 5 syllables per second, then this equates to men speaking t = 6611 and women speaking t = 3555
* Taking this further, this means men have had 826 working days (8h/day) of speech time, compared to women who have had 444 working days of speaking

> t = ((s/5)/60/60) where t = hours spoken and s = amount of syllables

## Introducing other variables
### Relationship between age and gender in parliamentary speech time
* This graph shows us the trend of the average amount of time spoken in parliament across an MSP's lifetime
* Interestingly, it tells us that men in their 30s/40s on average are speaking the most in parliament, whereas women peak in their contribution around the 50s mark
* It suggests that the amount of experience a women has had contributes to how much time she is given to speak in parliament, or to how much she feels confident to speak in parliament, whereas this correlation is not found in men

### Regional analysis
* These maps tells us the average amount of syllables spoken by each gender in each Scottish region
* It is worth noting there is more regional data for men as some regions have not had a female MSP
* These maps visualise parliamentary power as mapped power, with the darker regions showcasing where one gender has got more of a voice on matters
* The main comparative takeaway from these maps is that not only do men have more regions of which to represent, but they on average are speaking more than their female counterparts in their regions
* Another interesting note is that men on average are speaking more in the North of Scotland, rather than the South, where we see little contrast in shade (with the darker shades representing more syllables spoken)

### Cross-party analysis?

## The changing picture
Recap:
* So far, we have looked at overall statistics across all parliamentary sessions
* When we break down the data by either parliamentary session or year, we get a more fine-grained analysis where we can appreciate how the picture has changed over time

### Women's representation through parliamentary contributions over time

[stacked bar chart]
* Over the years, we've seen a general increase in amount of syllables spoken
* Although there has been a drive by men, with a 15% increase from 2000 to 2020 in syllables they've spoken, this has for the most part been driven by an increase in women's speech, where we've instead seen an 82% increase in the same timeframe


[2000 pie chart vs 2020 pie chart]
* But what does this look like in terms of changes in proportion of time spoken in parliament?
* In glancing at the previous chart, as well as by comparing these two pie charts, it's evident that women's proportion in parliamentary speech time has been increasing over the years
* Although promising, it doesn't tell us the full story yet: this is only exploring the proportions of speech time of each gender. To control for the differences in number of MSPs speaking per gender, we get a more accurate picture of the ratio between speech time and number of MSPs for each gender

[ratio of % of speech time to % of MSPs by parliamentary session line graph]
* This line graph represents this changing ratio across each parliamentary session
* As we can see, between teh first and third parliament we've seen a steady increase in speech time per female MSP, with this shooting up in the fourth parliament above 1, before steadying down back to below 1 in the fifth parliament
* This line tells us a promising x
