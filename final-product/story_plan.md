# The narrative
## Overview
* Absolute gender differences in amount of speech overall
    * When we sum the parliamentary data on speeches across all sessions, we can see that proportionally, men have had more time speaking than women
    * We can observe this disparity through the visual contrast of these speech bubbles, with men having spoken s = 119M syllables, and women just s = 64M
    * If we take the average speech time to be 5 syllables per second, then this equates to men speaking $t = 6611$ hours and women speaking $t = 3555$ hours
    * $t = ((s/5)/60/60)$ where $t$ = hours spoken and $s$ = amount of syllables
