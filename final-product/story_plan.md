# Are women underrepresented in Scottish politics?
## Overview
* Ways we have analysed representation:
   1.  Amount of time spent speaking in parliament - integrating other factors' effects for an intersectional analysis
   2.  Parliamentary discussions on women's topics
* Absolute gender differences in amount of speech
    * When we sum the parliamentary data on speeches across all sessions, we can see that proportionally, men have had more time speaking than women
    * We can observe this disparity through the visual contrast of these speech bubbles, with men having spoken s = 119M syllables, and women just s = 64M
    * If we take the average speech time to be 5 syllables per second, then this equates to men speaking t = 6611 and women speaking t = 3555
    * Taking it further, this means men have had 826 working days (8h/day) of speech, compared to women who have had 444 working days of speaking
    > t = ((s/5)/60/60) where t = hours spoken and s = amount of syllables

## The changing picture
