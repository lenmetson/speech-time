# Are women underrepresented in Scottish politics?
## Overview
Assumptions we have made about what constitutes women's political representation:
1.  Amount of time spent spoken by women in parliament
2.  Amount of parliamentary discussion on women's topics

### Absolute gender differences in amount of speech
[speech bubbles]
* When we sum the parliamentary data on speeches across all sessions, we can see that comparatively, men have spoken more than women
* We can observe this disparity through the visual contrast of these speech bubbles, with men having spoken s = 119M syllables, and women just s = 64M
* If we take the average speech time to be 5 syllables per second, then this equates to men speaking t = 6611 and women speaking t = 3555
* Taking this further, this means men have had 826 working days (8h/day) of speech time, compared to women who have had 444 working days of speaking

> t = ((s/5)/60/60) where t = hours spoken and s = amount of syllables

## Introducing other variables for an intersectional analysis
### Relationship between age and gender in parliamentary speech time
[age scatter graph]
* This graph shows us the trend of the average amount of time spoken in parliament across an MSP's lifetime
* Interestingly, it tells us that men in their 30s/40s on average are speaking the most in parliament, whereas women peak in their contribution around the 50s mark
* It suggests that the amount of experience a women has had contributes to how much time she is given to speak in parliament, or to how much she feels confident to speak in parliament, whereas this correlation is not found in men

### Regional analysis
[county map]
* These maps tells us the average amount of syllables spoken by each gender in each Scottish region
* It is worth noting there is more regional data for men as some regions have not had a female MSP
* These maps visualise parliamentary power as mapped power, with the darker regions showcasing where one gender has got more of a voice on matters
* The main comparative takeaway from these maps is that not only do men have more regions of which to represent, but they on average are speaking more than their female counterparts in their regions
* Another interesting note is that men on average are speaking more in the North of Scotland, rather than the South, where we see little contrast in shade (with the darker shades representing more syllables spoken)

## The changing picture
Recap:
* So far, we have looked at overall statistics across all parliamentary sessions
* When we break down the data by either parliamentary session or year, we get a more fine-grained analysis where we can appreciate how the picture has changed over time

### Women's representation through parliamentary contributions over time

[stacked bar chart]
* Over the years, we've seen a general increase in amount of syllables spoken
* Although there has been a drive by men, with a 15% increase from 2000 to 2020 in syllables they've spoken, this has for the most part been driven by an increase in women's speech, where we've instead seen an 82% increase in the same timeframe

[2000 pie chart vs 2020 pie chart]
* But what does this look like in terms of changes in proportion of time spoken in parliament?
* In glancing at the previous chart, as well as by comparing these two pie charts, it's evident that women's proportion in parliamentary speech time has been increasing over the years
* Although promising, it doesn't tell us the full story yet: this is only exploring the proportions of speech time of each gender. To control for the differences in number of MSPs speaking per gender, we get a more accurate picture of the ratio between speech time and number of MSPs for each gender

[ratio of % of speech time to % of MSPs by parliamentary session line graph]
* This line graph represents this changing ratio across each parliamentary session
* As we can see, between the first and third parliament we've seen a steady increase in speech time per female MSP, with this shooting up in the fourth parliament above 1, before steadying down back to below 1 in the fifth parliament
* This line tells us a promising story that the proportion of speech by women to the number of women has been steadily increasing to 1:1, suggesting that women take up the correct proportion of total speech time to the proportion of women that there are

### Translating parliamentary contributon representation to parliamentary seat representation
Where we're at:
* We've observed an increase in speech time of women in Scottish parliament, both in absolute terms and in proportion to the number of female MSPs in parliament
* One way we can contextualise this proportionate increase in the political setting is by visualising the amount of seats taken up in parliament by the proportion of speech time each gender has, and comparing this with the actual number of seats they have had throughout the years

[1st-3rd parliament seat map comparisons]
* These seat maps are representative of the first three parliamentary sessions
* A quick glance at the bottom row shows us that the situation is improving across sessions, however, comparing the actual number vs after speech time is taken into account data seat maps (i.e., looking at each column), we see that women are taking up less seats when their speech time is taken into account

[4th parliament seat map comparison]
* In the fourth parliament, we see that  women actually take up more seats with regards to the proportion of speech time they have. This was driven by structural changes such as Nicola Sturgeon coming into power.

[1st vs 5th parliament seat map comparison]
* When we compare the first parliament to the most recent (the fifth), we can see that although the actual number of female MSPs has decreased, the proportion of speech time from them has increased, leading to more parliamentary power.
* This can be clearly noted by comparing the bottom two seat maps.

### Sentiment analysis over time 
* By looking at the trends of women-focused speech for men and women, we see an improving picture - 2012 seems to be the year that triggered growth of convo amongst both genders, although much more extreme for women. The increase is steady and sustained which suggests it's not going to be because of a shock event (e.g. #MeToo) because politicians tend to loose focus of those issues with time (for example, almost no MP is giving interviews about cladding anymore whereas at some point that was all people talked about because of Grenfell). So the reason is going to be something like a shift in the structure of Scottish Politics.

## Moving forward
Results:
* Women generally speak more on women's issues than men, with 5.5% of women's speech being about women, with only 2.3% of men's being about women. This shows that our question is relevant. If women speak more about women's issues but get less opportunities to speak, women are not being suffiently represented. Descriptive representation matters for bringing women's' issues to parliament.
* Having Nicola Sturgeon elected for parliament has boosted women's representation by having a woman have central parliamentary power and lead both high-level debates and decision-making
* Women are speaking more per MSP in parliament, with the ratio of speech time to MSP currently at 4:5

Recommendations for further representation:
* We should focus less on encouraging women to speak more in parliament as they approach the same speech:MSP ratio as their male counterparts, and more on increasing the actual number of seats women possess in Scottish parliament. For example, party and reserved-seat quotas have been shown to be effective.
* As men both still have more seats and more speech time in absolute and proportional terms, we should strive for greater engagement by men with women's issues.

Opportunities for further analysis:
* As stated at the start, we have made certain assumptions about women's representation in Scottish politics. Opportunities for further analysis could be to test these assumptions, looking at the effects that these factors have on policy, media, and public opinion.
* This research has been descriptive as it was intended to quantify the extent of a problem. More detailed analysis would be needed to get at the causal aspects of women's representation in legislative settings. 
* While we have taken women's representation to be an intrinsic and aspirational good, more analysis could be done on extracting and quantifying evidence to support these claims in the Scottish political setting.
